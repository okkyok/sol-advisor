# Native Codex role contracts

Use these contracts with Sol Advisor's namespaced, role-pinned native custom agents.
They do not launch a nested Codex CLI or change global default-subagent routing.
Adapt every placeholder without removing a required field.

## Required preflight

Before every spawn, complete steps 1-2 of SKILL.md's preflight. After spawning,
complete steps 3-4 before accepting the result:

1. Require the non-mutating companion check to prove both installed files exactly
   match current templates and the retired companion file is absent.
2. Require native exposure of exactly `sol_advisor_terra_implementer` and
   `sol_advisor_sol_reviewer`.
3. Observe the selected role, model, and effort through public spawn/details metadata
   first, using the local runtime inspector only for omitted fields. Accept only
   Terra / High for implementation and Sol / High for review.
4. For the reviewer, capture actual sandbox policy and permission profile types.

A missing, stale, unsafe, conflicting, unavailable, inconsistent, or unobservable
role/model/effort stops the lane. Never silently fall back. Model and effort are pinned
by custom-agent TOML, so omit per-spawn overrides.

## Shared implementation contract

Every Terra prompt must contain all five sections:

~~~text
OBJECTIVE
<Observable outcome and why it matters.>

FILES AND OWNERSHIP
You own only:
- <exact file or module>

You are not alone in the codebase. Other agents or the user may be editing concurrently.
Preserve their edits, do not revert unrelated work, and adapt to changes already present.
Do not modify files outside your ownership.

INTERFACES
- <Signatures, types, schemas, commands, or behavior that must remain compatible.>

CONSTRAINTS
- <Repository conventions, safety boundaries, excluded scope, and settled decisions.>

VERIFICATION
- Run: <exact command>
  Success: <concrete expected result>
- Inspect: <exact file, diff, or generated artifact>
  Success: <concrete expected evidence>

RETURN
Return exact commands and actual evidence. A completion claim without evidence is invalid.

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
STATUS: complete | partial | blocked
OBJECTIVE: <one-line restatement>
CHANGES: <file-by-file summary from the actual diff>
VERIFIED: <exact commands plus concrete output evidence>
JUDGMENT CALLS: <decisions the specification left open, or none>
GAPS: <unfinished work, ambiguity, or none>
~~~

The primary session must inspect the diff and rerun verification itself.

## Terra / High - sole implementation lane

Use this lane for every delegated implementation, from routine edits through complex,
security-sensitive, context-heavy, and broad work.

Spawn exactly:

~~~text
agent_type: sol_advisor_terra_implementer
fork_turns: none
~~~

The installed role pins GPT-5.6 Terra at high reasoning. Do not attach per-spawn model
or reasoning fields. Require public-details-first runtime observation of the exact
role and pin before accepting its report.

Prompt:

~~~text
ROLE
Act as Sol Advisor's sole implementation worker. Resolve the supplied specification
within the settled architecture, preserve every stated interface and constraint, and
surface ambiguity instead of redesigning the architecture.

<paste and complete the Shared implementation contract>
~~~

## Fresh Sol - requested-read-only final reviewer

After parent verification, spawn a new native thread exactly:

~~~text
agent_type: sol_advisor_sol_reviewer
fork_turns: none
~~~

The installed role pins GPT-5.6 Sol at high reasoning and requests a read-only sandbox.
Do not attach per-spawn model or reasoning fields. Observe the actual role, pin,
sandbox policy, and permission profile before accepting its verdict.

Prompt:

~~~text
ROLE
Act as the fresh final reviewer. Remain strictly read-only: do not edit files, implement
fixes, or broaden scope.

STATED GOAL
<The user's requested outcome.>

ACCUMULATED CHANGE SET
<Exact allowed files plus complete working-tree diff, or explicit base/head revisions.>

INTERFACES AND CONSTRAINTS
- <Compatibility, repository rules, safety boundaries, and excluded scope.>

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
- <command> -> <actual primary-session output evidence>
- <artifact or diff inspection> -> <actual evidence>

REVIEW CYCLE
This is review <n> of at most 3 for this deliverable.
<For cycle 2 or 3 only:> Cycle 1 already defined the complete finding set. Judge only
(a) whether each open finding listed below is now resolved, and (b) regressions or new
defects introduced by the fix diffs. Report anything else under DEFERRED. Do not reopen
settled decisions, restate cycle-1 findings that are now resolved, or broaden scope.

OPEN FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS CYCLE
- <finding> -> <fix applied> -> <evidence>

REVIEW
Inspect the actual files and accumulated change set. Judge correctness, completeness,
regressions, scope discipline, interface preservation, test adequacy, and material risk.
Reserve `fix-first` for defects that block the stated goal or introduce material risk.
Style preferences, speculative hardening, and improvements outside the stated goal are
DEFERRED, not findings.

SOL REVIEW
CYCLE: <n> of 3
VERDICT: ship | fix-first | rethink
REASON: <decisive evidence-based reason>
FINDINGS: <in-scope blocking issues with precise file references, or none>
DEFERRED: <out-of-scope observations that must not trigger another fix cycle, or none>
RESIDUAL RISK: <most important remaining risk, or none>
~~~

If any fix is made after review, discard the verdict and run a new fresh review inside
the review budget. That budget is at most 3 final reviews per deliverable, tracked in
`${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/tmp/sol-advisor/review-ledger.md` so it survives context
compaction, and it is never reset by compaction, a corrected specification, an
architecture revision, or a renegotiated scope. When the budget is exhausted, a finding
survives two consecutive fix cycles, or `rethink` arrives at cycle 2 or later, stop the
loop and hand the unresolved findings and options back to the user instead of spawning
another lane. See SKILL.md's bounded-review-loop section for the full stop conditions.

Sol reviewing Sol is context-clean, not cross-model-family independence.

Use observed isolation, not requested isolation:

- With observed `read-only`, proceed with enforced isolation.
- If the host broadens it, proceed only when hard isolation is not required, the
  prompt forbids edits, and the parent captures and verifies exact before-and-after
  repository and artifact state. Report the broader policy and profile.
- If isolation is unobservable, hard isolation is required, or any mutation occurs,
  stop the lane and do not hide or repair the mutation under that verdict.

## Commitment-boundary Sol consult

For pre-implementation review, spawn the same fresh Sol role with `fork_turns: none`.
Give it the proposed decision, goal, constraints, relevant paths, alternatives, and the
one question that changes the plan. Require `proceed`, `change`, or `stop`, plus the
decisive reason and largest risk. Apply the same preflight, runtime-observation,
sandbox-reporting, and no-fallback rules.
